* What is Haskell?

** Haskell is a programming language that
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
- is pure
- is lazy
- has immutable data

** Haskell is Pure
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
- This means that functions _always_ return the same output for a given set of inputs, and
- they have no side effects

** Haskell is lazy
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
- data is only created as it is needed

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
#+begin_src haskell :results pp
-- an infinite list
xs = [1..]

-- take the first 10
take 10 xs
#+end_src

#+results: 
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |

* Why Haskell is Cool
- A new way to think about programming
- expressive, concise and clear
- beautiful
